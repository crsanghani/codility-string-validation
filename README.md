#String tech test

##Test 1

The aim of the test is to properly validate a string and return the length of the first valid string.

All strings chains must have a capital, a lower case character but no integers.

Example

```
  string = '0ABd02'
  evaluates to 3

  string = 'as14A89Rfgs93Ag'
  evaluates to 4
```

```
  string = '0ABd02'
  evaluates to 'ABd'

  string = 'as14A89Rfgs93Ag'

```
